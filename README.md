# Credit-Risk-Analysis

This project analyzes borrower behaviour, identifies key financial risk patterns, and builds machine learning models to predict the likelihood of loan default.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify borrowers into **safe** or **risky** categories based on historical lending data.  
The workflow includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation and comparison

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**

##  Processes & Methods
### **1️ Data Preparation**
- Handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding  
- Standardized numerical features  
- Addressed data imbalances

### **2️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution analysis of income, debt, credit score  
- Visualizing correlations & borrower risk patterns  
- Outlier detection  
- Feature relationship analysis  

### **3️ Machine Learning Modeling**
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees / Random Forest  
- Model comparison using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision & Recall  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - ROC-AUC Curve  

### **4️ Insights**
- Identified key risk indicators influencing borrower default  
- Used model outputs to enhance decision-making for credit assessment

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of **data preprocessing**, **statistical analysis**, and **machine learning** in a real-world financial risk scenario.  
It showcases the ability to build predictive systems that support informed lending decisions.
